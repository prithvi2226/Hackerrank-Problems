what is java?
programming language lol

srsly how does this work-

------   |---------|
|Code|-->| COMPILER|---> 101011100011
------   |---------|

Source file-->compile--->Byte Code

Since java is platform independent, we need a platform to run it.

The Platform is also  known as the virtual machine.

And this virtaul machine will only work with byte code.

This virtual machine will only work with java source file,
therefore, its called java virtual machine(JVM).
